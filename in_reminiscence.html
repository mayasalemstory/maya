                  I don’t think Baba has experienced this divide of language and being perceived; at least, he’s never talked about it. Maybe by the time he arrived in this country, he wasn’t concerned with his perception, or explaining himself to another person. He was surrounded by other Lebanese students. He put his head down, studying and working to capitalize on the opportunity he’d been given. </p>
              <p>
                  Or maybe he doesn’t remember, because when everything about him was different, the little things were little. </p>
              <p>
                  These words and foods are not only normal. They’re mundane, just another category of words to experiment with. They don’t require explanation. </p>
              <p>
                  The words lose their universality, and they become the softened wood panels on the floor of the kitchen and the fabric of the re-upholstered dining room chairs. Za’atar is the savory scent of Saturday morning. Fattoush, the minty and lemony side salad to Sunday nights. </p>
              <p>
                  I feel like I require explanation. For why I pronounce hummus as <em>hummus</em>. And tread so lightly when talking about any given Lebanese dish, because I’ll need to describe each part of it, from the flavors to the name of the cheese, to the seasoning. That the sumac I put on top of my open-faced cheese pie is not from the deadly plant. (I don’t actually know where it’s from, but it’s definitely not poisonous.) </p>
              <p>
                  Meanwhile, Baba fondly remembers (and still stands by) his decision to pair together watermelon and hummus one afternoon in Boston, when that’s all he had in his fridge. Refreshing. He’s the real cultural crossover, dipping pita bread into guacamole and tortilla chips into hummus. </p>
               <p></p>
                <p><strong>HOLD FOR ILLUSTRATION/ANIMATION</strong></p>
              <p></p>
              
              <p>
                  Weeks pass at the farmer’s market, and due to one obstacle or another, I don’t get the chance to perform my Arabic nod at the Lebanese food stall. My final Saturday in Scotland arrives, and I walk down to the market, knowing I cannot purchase anything as I leave in a few days. </p>
              <p>
                  Rehearsing my Arabic and my story in English, I make my way to the stall. I want to thank them for their food and its impact on my time in Scotland, seeing them each weekend. But as I round the bend and get a glimpse at the white-tableclothed stand, I don’t see my falafel friend. I wander around for a few minutes, poking around the nearby stands, believing he must be grabbing more ingredients from his truck. But he doesn’t return. </p>
              <p>
                  As I walk back to my flat, empty-handed, I think about visiting the Hummus restaurant again. I don’t know what for, though. I cannot carry any more of an Arabic conversation now than I could during my first visit. </p>
              <p>
                  Without the crutch of a bilingual and bicultural father or normalcy of surrounding Americans who are concerned with their own culture, I don’t know how I’m supposed to be perceived. How I’m supposed to represent myself. Baba and I are on opposite coasts of these two landmasses with an ocean in between. There’s no quietly pleading for help, nobody feeding me words to repeat. There’s no person beside me sharing my genetic makeup, offering an explanation. There’s only me flailing, my arms outstretched, grabbing onto empty water, and trying to swim upwards. </p>
              <p>
                  I recall one frigid morning during my last few weeks in Edinburgh. I’m standing at a bus stop at the city center. My hands are stuffed in my pockets, as I squint at the numbers on the approaching buses. An elderly woman stands very still next to me. She acknowledges me and I nod, smiling back at her. Somewhere behind me, a man shouts, his voice quickly lost to the bustling soundscape of the moving streets. </p>
              <p>
                  I hear another shout evolving into a yell. It sounds like someone is being harassed. I look around to observe the situation and figure out who he is yelling at. He’s staring directly at me. </p>
              <p>
                  “You Indian?” His eyes are wide, and his head is turning on its axis. “You Indian? You Indian?” </p>
              <p>
                  I slowly shake my head, wondering if I need to start planning my escape, if it was a mistake to turn around and make eye contact. He stares at me for one second longer. Once his evaluation is over, he seems satisfied, pivots, and walks away. </p>
              <p>
                  I inch back to looking at the street, avoiding the gaze of the few bystanders, my eyes glazing over the vehicles passing. I don’t remember the bus number I’m waiting for. </p>
              <p>
                  The old woman next to me breaks the silence, asking about some incoming bus. She has no teeth, which makes it very difficult to understand the specifics of her question, and there’s only so many times you can politely ask someone to repeat themselves. I point to the screen with the arriving bus numbers, hoping it helps. </p>
              <p>
                  After a few moments, she turns back to me and asks what the man was yelling about. </p>
              <p>
                  “He was asking me if I was Indian, I think?” </p>
              <p>
                  She doesn’t reply.</p>
              <p>
                  “What did you say?” she turns back, studying me.</p>
              <p>
                  “I said, no. I don’t know if that’s the answer he wanted, but he left.”</p>
              <p>
                  She nods, in what I assume is equal bafflement. </p>
              <p>
                  The squeal and sigh of a bus arriving steals my attention, and I recognize the number. I climb up the stairs and take a seat on the second floor. As the bus pulls away, I look back at the stop, where the small old woman stands, still. </p>
              <p>
                  I can’t quite figure out how to feel. I pull out my phone to message a group chat of other exchange students, telling them what happened. They respond with <em>oh that sucks, sorry that happened.</em> </p>
              <p>
                  I text my family. Only my mom responds, asking if I think the man needed help or was aggressive. I want to explain, but the conversation moves on without me. </p>
